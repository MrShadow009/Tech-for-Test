# TODO: Make Website Responsive for Laptop and Mobile

- [ ] Remove `zoom: 150%` from body CSS to fix mobile display issues
- [ ] Fix media queries: Change `.college-header` to `.header` in responsive styles
- [ ] Add Bootstrap container, row, and col classes to HTML structure for better grid responsiveness
- [ ] Adjust layout-grid to use Bootstrap grid system (e.g., col-md-4, col-lg-3)
- [ ] Improve mobile styles: Stack elements vertically, adjust font sizes and padding
- [ ] Refine CTA card positioning for mobile (make it relative or adjust fixed position)
- [ ] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [ ] Ensure clean UI: Consistent spacing, readable text, and proper alignment
